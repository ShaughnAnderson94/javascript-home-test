# OakNorth JavaScript Home Test

Notes: 
1. index.html file just made because I am used to working with console loging to html console and don't yet know how to work with external libaries.
2. Code history.txt is just something I made for me since I do some youtube tutorials and it helps me to keep a bunch of old versions of the code with notes but if you want to see my process in doing the task its there.
3. Regardless of where it goes I am looking forwards to the pair coding exercize it sounds like it will be a really oppertunity to learn.
