first made index.html to test through console. npm install and test was returning passed all the time and since we have been taught not to use
external libraries while working on the course I wasnt sure what to do about it but wanted to proceed with the task.

started with code to handle type

function assertEquals(expect, actual) {
    if(typeof expect !== typeof actual){
        console.log(`Expected type ${typeof expect} but found type ${typeof actual}`);
    }
}
assertEquals(1, '1');
